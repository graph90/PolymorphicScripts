# PolymorphicScripts

**PolymorphicScripts** features a Python script that dynamically generates polymorphic versions of itself, highlighting advanced techniques in code obfuscation and polymorphism. This project illustrates how to create adaptable, stealth code with self modifying scripts.

## Overview

The core of this project is a Python script that autonomously generates new versions of itself with polymorphic properties. Each generated script demonstrates various coding techniques including:

- **Dynamic Function Naming:** Functions are given random names to obscure their purpose.
- **Advanced Encryption:** Encryption methods are applied to demonstrate data security and obfuscation.
- **Self Modifying Code:** The script creates and executes new versions of itself, showcasing adaptive programming techniques.

## Features

- **Polymorphic Code Generation:** Automatically generates scripts with unique characteristics.
- **Code Obfuscation:** Implements techniques to make code less readable and harder to reverse engineer.
- **Randomized Elements:** Functions and variables are dynamically named to enhance stealth.
- **Encryption Methods:** Demonstrates encryption for secure data handling.
